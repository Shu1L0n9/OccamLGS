This is the official implementation of "Occam's LGS: An Efficient Approach for Language Gaussian Splatting".

## Overview

Occam's LGS is a simple, training-free approach for Language-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting that achieves state-of-the-art results with a 100x speed improvement. Our method:

- ðŸŽ¯ Lifts 2D language features to 3D Gaussian Splats without complex modules or training
- ðŸš€ Provides 100x faster optimization compared to existing methods  
- ðŸ§© Works with any feature dimension without compression
- ðŸŽ¨ Enables easy scene manipulation and object insertion

## Installation Guide

### System Requirements
We use the following setting to run OccamLGS:

- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
- PyTorch 2.2.2
- Python 3.10
- GCC 11.4.0

### Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shu1l0n9/occamlgs.git --recursive
```

### Environment Setup
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Dataset Preparation
### Input Dataset
The dataset follows a structured format where each 3D scene is organized as follows:
```
lerf_ovs/
â””â”€â”€ scene_name/           # Name of the specific scene (e.g., teatime)
    â”œâ”€â”€ distorted/        
    â”œâ”€â”€ images/           # Contains the original, unprocessed scene images
    â”œâ”€â”€ language_features/ # Pre-extracted language embeddings
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ frame_00001_f.npy
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ frame_00001_s.npy
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
    â”œâ”€â”€ sparse/0/      
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ test.txt     # Testing image list
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ cameras.bin 
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ images.bin
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ points3D.bin 
    â”œâ”€â”€ stereo/         
```
Notes:
- Language features are pre-extracted and stored as 512-dimensional vectors
- ```bash process.sh``` script is provided to preprocess the dataset and extract language features from the images
- For detailed information about feature levels and language feature extraction methodology, please refer to the [LangSplat repository](https://github.com/minghanqin/LangSplat). 

### Output Directory Structure
The pre-trained RGB model outputs are organized as follows:
```
output/
â””â”€â”€ dataset_name/
    â””â”€â”€ scene_name/
        â”œâ”€â”€ point_cloud/
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ iteration_30000/
        â”‚       â””â”€â”€ point_cloud.ply      # Point cloud at 30K iterations
        â”œâ”€â”€ cameras.json                 
        â”œâ”€â”€ cfg_args                     
        â”œâ”€â”€ chkpnt30000.pth             # Model checkpoint at 30K iterations
        â””â”€â”€ input.ply                    

```
After running the `gaussian_feature_extractor.py` for three levels of features, three additional checkpoint files are added:

```
output/
â””â”€â”€ dataset_name/
    â””â”€â”€ scene_name/
        â”œâ”€â”€ point_cloud/
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ iteration_30000/
        â”‚       â””â”€â”€ point_cloud.ply      # Point cloud at 30K iterations
        â”œâ”€â”€ cameras.json                
        â”œâ”€â”€ cfg_args                    
        â”œâ”€â”€ chkpnt30000.pth             # RGB model checkpoint
        â”œâ”€â”€ input.ply                   
        â”œâ”€â”€ chkpnt30000_langfeat_1.pth  # Language features level 1
        â”œâ”€â”€ chkpnt30000_langfeat_2.pth  # Language features level 2
        â””â”€â”€ chkpnt30000_langfeat_3.pth  # Language features level 3

```

Note:  The script `gaussian_feature_extractor.py` generates three new semantic checkpoints, each containing a different level of language features while maintaining the same RGB model weights from the original checkpoint.

## Usage


### Prerequisites

-  A pre-trained RGB Gaussian model (use `train.py` and `render.py` commands below to train a model on your scene using gsplat renderer)
- `test.txt` file in `scene_name/sparse/0/` defining test set


#### 1. Train and Render RGB Gaussian Model
```bash
# Train gaussian model
python train.py -s $DATA_SOURCE_PATH -m $MODEL_OUTPUT_PATH --iterations 30000

# Render trained model
python render.py -m $MODEL_OUTPUT_PATH --iteration 30000
```

#### 2. Feature Extraction and Visualization
```bash
#  gaussian feature vectors
python gaussian_feature_extractor.py -m $MODEL_OUTPUT_PATH --iteration 30000 --eval --feature_level 1

# Render feature maps
python feature_map_renderer.py -m $MODEL_OUTPUT_PATH --iteration 30000 --eval --feature_level 1
```
### Example Pipeline
Check `run_lerf.sh` for a complete example using the "teatime" scene from LERF_OVS dataset and `run_3DOVS.sh` for a complete example using the "bench" scene from 3D-OVS dataset.

## Evaluation
### LERF
We follow the evaluation methodology established by LangSplat for our LERF assessments. For detailed information about the evaluation metrics and procedures, please refer to the LangSplat methodology.

### 3DOVS
Here is the instructions on how to evaluate 3DOVS Dataset.
1. Configure Parameters: Open `eval_3DOVS.sh` and adjust the following:
    - `DATASET_NAME`: Set to your 3DOVS dataset split (e.g., "bench")
    - `GT_FOLDER`: Path to your preprocessed 3DOVS data
    - `FEAT_FOLDER_NAME`: Name of your model's feature output folder
2. Run the evaluation script
```bash
sh eval_3DOVS.sh
```
3. View Results: Evaluation metrics and visualizations will be saved to the `/eval_results` directory

**Configuration Options**

The evaluation script supports several parameters:

- `--stability_thresh`: Threshold for stability analysis (default: 0.4)
- `--min_mask_size`: Minimum valid mask size (default: 0.005)
- `--max_mask_size`: Maximum valid mask size (default: 0.9)

For detailed information about our evaluation methodology, please refer to the supplementary materials in our paper.


## TODO
